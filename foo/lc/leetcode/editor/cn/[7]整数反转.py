# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer. 
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: 123
# Output: 321
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: -123
# Output: -321
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: 120
# Output: 21
#  
# 
#  Note: 
# Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers with
# in the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For the purpose of this pro
# blem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
