# You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.
#
# Initially the number of elements in A and B are m and n respectively.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
# A = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
# B = [2,5,6],       n = 3
#
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
